## Toxtree - Toxic Hazard Estimation by decision tree approach

Toxtree  is  a  full-featured   and  flexible  user-friendly  open  source application, which is able to estimate toxic hazard by applying a  decision tree approach. 
   
Toxtree could  be applied  to datasets from various compatible file  types. User-defined  molecular  structures  are also  supported  -  they could  be     entered by  SMILES, or by using the built-in  2D structure diagram  editor.

The  Toxtree  application  is suitable  for a  standalone PC and can run on any platform, supported by Java 1.6 or higher.

##Modular design

Toxtree has  been   designed with  flexible capabilities  for future  extensions in  mind (e.g. other classification schemes that could be developed at a future date). New decision trees with arbitrary rules can be built with the help of graphical user interface or by developing new plug-ins.
