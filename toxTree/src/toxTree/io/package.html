Input output support. This is mainly an extension of <a href="http://cdk.sourceforge.net/api/org/openscience/cdk/io/package-frame.html">The CDK</a> io package 
in order to support .CSV and .TXT files.
<p>
CSV files and tab delimited .TXT files can be read/written by MS Excel :)
<hr>
A column with "SMILES" heading is mandatory for CSV/TXT files in order the structure to be read. All other fields are 
optional, will be read as molecule properties and displayed as such.
<p>
Decision tree results are written as SDF properties or CSV/TXT columns. The class assignment is stored in a property 
<u>"toxTree.tree.cramer.CramerRules"</u>. The tree path is stored in a property <u>"toxTree.tree.cramer.CramerTreeResult"</u>.
