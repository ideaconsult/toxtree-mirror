This packages contains only interface definitions, defining essential classes in toxTree application.
<UL>
<LI>A decision tree should implement interface {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionMethod}
<LI>A decision rule should implement interface {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionRule}
<LI>The application of a decision tree on a query molecule 
assigns it to a category {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionCategory}
<LI>The path followed through the decision tree should be provided by  {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionResult}
</UL>
The existence of these interfaces allows various implementation of decision rules, trees and categories, 
which can nevertheless be used interdependently.
<P>
A set of classes implementing these interfaces can be found in package {@link toxTree.tree}
<p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
Plugins are .jar files, containing any one or all of the following: 
<ul>
<li>Decision tree(s), i.e. classes implementing {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionMethod}
<li>Rule(s), i.e. classes implementing {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionRule} 
<li>Categories, i.e. classes implementing {@link toxTree.core.IDecisionCategory}
</ul>
Plugins are searched at run-time in the following directories:
<ul>
<li>The directory where toxTree.jar resides (current directory).
<li>The directory "ext" below the current directory.
</ul>
Plugins containing decision trees are searched when presenting a list of available trees.
Plugins containing rules are searched when presenting a list of available rules.
Plugins containing categories are searched when presenting a list of available categories.
<br>
The Cramer tree {@link toxTree.tree.cramer.CramerRules} is used by default, but relies on the same mechanism. It is distributed in toxCramer.jar.
A demo decision tree is available at {@link toxTree.tree.demo.SubstructureTree} and distributed in toxDemo.jar.
