# ![](images/toxtree-logo.png) Toxtree - Toxic Hazard Estimation by decision tree approach

Toxtree  is  a  full-featured   and  flexible  user-friendly  open  source application, which is able to estimate toxic hazard by applying a  decision tree approach. 
   
Toxtree could  be applied  to datasets from various compatible file  types. User-defined  molecular  structures  are also  supported  -  they could  be entered by  [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system), or by using the built-in  [2D structure diagram  editor](https://jchempaint.github.io/).

The  Toxtree  application  is suitable  for a  standalone PC and can run on any platform, supported by Java 1.6 or higher.

Toxtree has  been   designed with  flexible capabilities  for future  extensions in  mind (e.g. other classification schemes that could be developed at a future date). New decision trees with arbitrary rules can be built with the help of graphical user interface or by developing new plug-ins.
