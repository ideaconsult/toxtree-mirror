Toxtree 1.40.

<b>ToxTree 1.20, ToxForest 1.03.</b>
Changelog:
<ul>
<li> User and installation manuals updated
<li> Added global options for Skin irritation rules (in addition to rule specific)
<li> Added "Silent" for Skin irritation rules (the answer of the property rule will always be "No" if a property is missing).
<li> Improved implementation of Verhaar scheme Class 4.
<li> Fixed bug (Error when writing SMARTS rule to .tree file)
</ul>


<b>ToxTree 1.13, ToxForest 1.02.</b>
Changelog:
<ul>
<li> Fixed bug (last compound from the file is ignored when applying a decision tree)
<li> Fixed bug (impossible to edit the example compound for a rule)
<li> Fixed bug - changes in tree were not appearing instantly

<li> Added possibility to delete decision tree from the decision forest.
<li> Warning message when saving files to avoid overwriting.
<li> Changed JChemPaint to launch in nonmodal window in some cases 
<li> When selecting a file without extension, the selected extension is added automatically.
<li> Added hints in compound properties area, to view the data if the row is too long
<li> Added menu to delete unused categories
<li> Added Compounds/Find menu to look for a compound by property
<li> Added Compounds/Subsets menu to display subsets of compounds, belonging to certain category. 
<li>- Added XML based format for saving trees (.tml) and forests (.fml). This is because .tree and .forest formats are incompatible between different ToxForest/ToxTree versions.
</ul>

	<b>Toxtree 1.11</b> is an upgrade of a <b>Toxtree 1.00</b>. The main changes are:
	<ul>
<li>Uses more recent version of CDK library (CDK SVN snapshot from June 2006)
<li>Completely redesigned decision tree visual editor
<li>Support for SMARTS, based on JOELIB library http://joelib.sourceforge.net/ 
</ul>

   <b>Toxtree 1.00</b> is a full-featured and flexible user-friendly open source
  application, which is able to estimate toxic hazard by applying a decision
  tree approach.  Currently it 
  <UL><LI>Encodes the Cramer scheme <u>Cramer G. M., R. A.
  Ford, R. L. Hall, Estimation of Toxic Hazard - A Decision Tree Approach, J.
  Cosmet. Toxicol., Vol.16, pp. 255-276, Pergamon Press, 1978 </u>
  <li>Could be applied to datasets from various compatible file types (MOL, MOL2, SDF, CML,
  XYZ,  HIN, CDX , SMI, TXT and CSV);
  <li>User-defined molecular structures could be entered by SMILES or by a <a href="http://jchempaint.sourceforge.net">JChemPaint</a> structure diagram editor;
  <li>Provides support for modifying the tree and defining new decision trees.
  </ul>

  Cheminformatics functionality in {@link toxTree.apps.ToxTreeApp} relies on <a href="http://cdk.sourceforge.net/api/index.html">The Chemistry Development Kit</a>
