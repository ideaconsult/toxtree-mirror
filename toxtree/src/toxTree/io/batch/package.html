Batch processing facility. It allows faster processing without 
loading simultaneously all the compounds into memory. Preffered  if the file has more than thousand compounds. 
A batch could be paused, continued after pause or cancelled. 
<br>
Batch configuration (i.e. 
        input/output file and processed records) could be saved in a file, 
        loaded and continued in a later moment, even after the application has 
        been closed and started again later. 
        <br>
        Batch configuration is saved in a 
        temporary file by default. This file is deleted if the batch completes 
        successfully. If the batch configuration is saved into a user defined 
        file, it will persist even after the batch completes;
