title=Does the structure contain a functional group (...) that is hydrolyzed or reduced?
explanation=Does the structure contain a functional group (carbon-based ester, including di-and tri-esters), orthoester, thioester, acetal, ketal, hemiacetal or hemiketal) that is hydrolyzed, or a polysulfide or sulfoxide that is reduced under conditions present in the gastric (pH=1.8) or intestinal fluid (pH=7.8-8.5) or in circulation prior to first-pass metabolism?<br/>If yes, the substance is expected to undergo hydrolysis or reduction, consider the resulting product structures, in turn, in question 2. <br/><i>Note:</i> The highest CDT class for any of the products will be assigned to the original substance.
