explanation=Does the substance contain any one or more of the following carbon moieties or functional groups?<ul><li>A. Allyl alcohol or its ester (Note: this ester should have been hydrolyzed in Q1)</li><li>B. Allyl mercaptan, allyl polysulfide, an allyl thioesters that may be hydrolyzed to allyl mercaptan</li><li>C. Allyl amine</li><li>D. Acrolein or methacrolein</li><li>E. Acrylic acid or methacrylic acid</li><li>F. An acetylenic substance</li><li>G. An acyclic gamma diketone, its precursor diol, monoketone or precursor hydrocarbon of less than ten carbons. Included in this group would be hexane,2-hexanol, or 2,5-hexanedione or 3,6-heptandione with or without  b) methyl substituents between the ketone functions</li><li>H.
