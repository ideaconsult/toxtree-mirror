explanation=Predicts the toxicological hazard (when administered orally) from the molecular structure. <ul><li>Low (Class I) : Substances with simple chemical structures and for which efficient modes of metabolism exist,suggesting a low order of oral toxicity.<h6>Fifth percentile NOEL (mg/kg bw/day)  3.0 <br>Human exposure threshold  (mg/person/day)  1.8</h6><li>Intermediate (Class II) :Substances which possess structures that are less innocuous than class I substances, but do not contain structural features suggestive of toxicity like those substances in class III. <h6>Fifth percentile NOEL (mg/kg bw/day)  0.91<br> Human exposure threshold  (mg/person/day)  0.54</h6><li>High (Class III).Substances with chemical structures that permit no strong initial presumption of safety or may even suggest significant toxicity or have reactive functional groups.<h6>Fifth percentile NOEL (mg/kg bw/day)  0.15<br> Human exposure threshold  (mg/person/day)  0.09</h6></ul>
