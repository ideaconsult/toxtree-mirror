INTRODUCTION

    Toxtree  is  a  full-featured   and  flexible  user-friendly  open   source
    application, which is able to estimate toxic hazard by applying a  decision
    tree approach. Currently it includes the following plugins:

    - Cramer rules (Cramer G. M., R.  A. Ford, R. L. Hall, Estimation of  Toxic
    Hazard - A  Decision Tree Approach,  J. Cosmet. Toxicol.,  Vol.16,  pp. 255
    -276, Pergamon Press, 1978);

    - Verhaar scheme for predicting toxicity mode of actions (Verhaar HJM,  van
    Leeuwen CJ and Hermens JLM (1992) Classifying environmental pollutants.  1.
    Structure-activity  relationships  for  prediction  of  aquatic   toxicity.
    Chemosphere 25, 471-491);

    - A decision tree for  estimating skin irritation and corrosion  potential,
    based on rules published in “The Skin Irritation Corrosion Rules Estimation
    Tool  (SICRET),  John  D. Walker,  Ingrid  Gerner,  Etje Hulzebos,  Kerstin
    Schlegel, QSAR Comb. Sci. 2005, 24, pp. 378-384”;

    - A decision  tree for estimating  eye irritation and  corrosion potential,
    based on rules published in “Assessment of the eye irritating properties of
    chemicals by applying alternatives to  the Draize rabbit eye test:  the use
    of  QSARs and  in vitro  tests for  the classification  of eye  irritation,
    Ingrid  Gerner,  Manfred  Liebsch   &  Horst  Spielmann,  Alternatives   to
    Laboratory Animals, 2005, 33, pp. 215-237”;

    - A decision tree for estimating carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, based on
    the rules  published in  the document:  “The Benigni  / Bossa  rulebase for
    mutagenicity and carcinogenicity – a module of Toxtree”, by R. Benigni,  C.
    Bossa, N. Jeliazkova, T. Netzeva, and A. Worth. European Commission  report
    EUR 23241 EN;

    - START (Structural  Alerts for Reactivity  in Toxtree) biodegradation  and
    persistence plug-in  is based  on a  compilation of  structural alerts  for
    environmental persistence and biodegradability. These structural alerts are
    molecular functional groups or substructures that are known to be linked to
    the  environmental  persistence  or  biodegradability  of  chemicals.   The
    rulebase utilizes the structural alerts  in logical decision trees. If  one
    or more the  structural alerts embedded  in the molecular  structure of the
    chemical  are recognized,  the system  flags the  potential persistence  or
    biodegradability of the chemical. Installation and user manuals  available;

    - Structure Alerts for the in vivo micronucleus assay in rodents, based  on
    the rules, published in the document “Development of structural alerts  for
    the in vivo  micronucleus assay in  rodents”, by Romualdo  Benigni, Cecilia
    Bossa, Olga Tcheremenskaia and Andrew Worth, European Commission report EUR
    23844 EN;

    - Cramer  rules with  extensions: This  plug-in is  a copy  of the original
    plug-in, plus minor extensions. Like the Cramer plug-in, this plug-in works
    by assigning compounds to Class I, II, or III, according to the rules  from
    Cramer, and some extra ones. Several compounds were classified by Munro  in
    1996 as Class I or Class  II compounds according to the Cramer  rules, even
    though Munro reported low NOEL values upon oral administration  (indicating
    relatively high toxicity). To overcome such misclassifications, five  rules
    have been introduced to capture the possible toxicity of  these  compounds;

    - Structure Alerts  for identification of  Michael Acceptors: This  plug-in
    contains structural alerts, able to identify Michael Acceptors, as  defined
    in 	T. Wayne Schultz, Jason W. Yarbrough, Robert S. Hunter, Aynur O. Aptula

    Toxtree could  be applied  to datasets from various compatible file  types.
    User-defined  molecular  structures  are also  supported  -  they could  be
    entered by  SMILES, or by using the built-in  2D structure diagram  editor.

    The  Toxtree  application  is suitable  for a  standalone PC.  It has  been
    designed with  flexible capabilities  for future  extensions in  mind (e.g.
    other classification schemes that could be developed at a future date). New
    decision trees with arbitrary rules can be built with the help of graphical
    user interface or by developing new plug-ins.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS & INSTALLATION

    Toxtree requires Java(TM)  2 Runtime Environment,  Standard Edition 1.6  or
    newer on the  target system and  it is platform-independent.  It runs under
    any host operating  system, which supports Java(TM) 2 Runtime  Environment,
    Standard Edition.

    The  Toxtree  application is  distributed  with a  fully  automated offline
    installer (Toxtree-vX.Y.Z-setup.exe),  compatible with  recent versions  of
    the Microsoft Windows  (NT, 2000, XP,  2003) operating system.  In order to
    install Toxtree  just run  the installer  and follow  its instructions.  It
    contains  all  the  required packages,  including  the  Java(TM) 2  Runtime
    Environment, Standard Edition 1.6 setup.

    If the installer does not detect Java(TM) 2 Runtime  Environment,  Standard
    Edition 1.6 or  newer on the  target system, it will attempt to install  it
    before proceeding with  the Toxtree setup.  In this case,  the user running
    the installer SHOULD  HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE PRIVILEGES  on the target  system
    (otherwise the Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition setup would
    be aborted and Toxtree would not be installed).

    If the installer detects  Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment,  Standard Edition
    1.6  or  newer  already installed  on the  target system,  it will  proceed
    directly with the  Toxtree setup. In  this case, ADMINISTRATIVE  PRIVILEGES
    ARE RECOMMENDED BUT NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED.
    
    When the installer is launched by a user with administrative privileges, it
    will create Toxtree  start menu shortcuts  for all the  users registered in
    the target system. Otherwise, start menu shortcuts will be created only for
    the unprivileged user, who launched the installation.

    After a successful installation, Toxtree  could be launched from the  Start
    Menu ("Start ->  All Programs ->  Ideaconsult -> Toxtree-vX.Y.Z  -> Toxtree
    -vX.Y.Z").

    Each version of Toxtree could  be uninstalled either by using  the "Control
    Panel  -> Add  or Remove  Programs" or  by  clicking  the "Uninstall"  link
    located  in  "Start  -> All  Programs ->  Ideaconsult ->  Toxtree-vX.Y.Z ->
    Uninstall-Toxtree-vX.Y.Z". Any  application files  which may  happen to  be
    locked  during the  uninstall procedure  would be  deleted after  the  next
    reboot  of the  system. Java(TM)  2 Runtime  Environment, Standard  Edition
    would not be uninstalled by the Toxtree uninstaller. If needed, it could be
    uninstalled via its own entry in "Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs".

    - updated CDK library;

    - updated README.

    * Toxtree-v1.00 (build date 23 Oct 2005):

    - added complete application documentation, including installation  manual,
    user manual, updated README, documentation of the source code;

    - improvements of the decision tree editor.

    * Toxtree-v0.05 (build date 14 Oct 2005):

    - user defined decision tree concept introduced;

    - decision trees can be saved to  and loaded from a file (a custom  ".tree"
    file type is used);

    - added graphical user interface for building decision trees;

    - the structure diagram editor  (JChemPaint) is now launched as  a nonmodal
    dialog.  This  resolves  the   issue  of  some  JChemPaint   windows  being
    inaccessible if the editor is launched as a modal dialog;

    - after  structure is  edited in  JChemPaint, SMILES  is created  and other
    properties  are retained;

    - new command line options are introduced:

    java -jar Toxtree.jar -f <input file for normal open>

    java -jar Toxtree.jar -b <finput file for batch processing>

    - improved recognition of carbohydrates;

    - several nucleotides added to bodymol.sdf according to an expert advice;

    - batch processing can not be  started anymore when input and output  files
    are the same;

    - Q11: when a heterocyclic ring substituents are analysed, only heteroatoms
    in the ring analysed  are disregarded (as specified  in the Cramer et  all,
    1976) but not the heteroatoms in other rings. This behaviour is the one  of
    v0.03. In  the v0.04  release the  behaviour was  changed to  disregard all
    heteroatoms, which doesn't follow the specification of Q11 to analyze  each
    ring separately,  with the  remainder of  the structure  as substituents of
    that heteroring;

    - added the application source code in the installers;

    * Toxtree-v0.04 (build date 04 Oct 2005):

    - Q5: better heuristics for carbohydrates;

    -  Q6:  return  "yes"  only if  the  a)-  and  b)-substituents are  present
    simultaneously;

    - Q9: if it is  a lactone from this point  on treat the structure as  if it
    were the hydroxy acid;

    - Q11: ketone changed to R-C(=O)-R where R is not (O or H);

    -  checked  the  search  path for  bodymol.sdf  and  foodmol.sdf,  when the
    application is run from the installer;

    - checked that compounds are  assigned always the highest (most  hazardous)
    class of their constituents/hydrolysis products;

    - optimized searching in foodmol.sdf and bodymol.sdf;

    - updated foodmol.sdf and bodymol.sdf according to an expert advice;

    - added  Back/Forward buttons  for easier navigation in the history of  the
    SMILES drop down list;

    - made the SMILES entry panel inaccessible for user input, when there is an
    open file. The name  of the file is  displayed instead of the  SMILES entry
    panel. If changes are made in the file contents in memory, an  asterisk (*)
    is displayed after the file name. The asterisk is removed after saving  the
    file. Access to the SMILES entry panel is restored after File/New.

    - added keyboard shortcut (hotkey CTRL+SHIFT+T) for application launching;

    - added Start Menu tool tips;

    - minor enhancements of the installers;

    - updated README.

    * Toxtree-v0.03 (build date 30 Sep 2005):

    - included a  2D molecular structure  editor based on  JChemPaint. It could
    be accessed via the Compound/Edit menu;

    - processes correctly SDF, CSV and TXT files with empty molecules;

    - fixed incorrect perception of a specific functional groups configuration;

    - bodymol.sdf and foodmol.sdf updated according to an expert advice;

    - minor enhancements of the user interface;

    - updated README.

    * Toxtree-v0.02 (build date 25 Sep 2005):

    - Q1 and Q22: implemented to  look up for "normal constituent of  the body"
    and "common component of food" in bodymol.sdf and foodmol.sdf respectively.
    Only  a very  limited number  of molecules  are listed  currently in  these
    files. The user can  replace these files with  his own files, provided  the
    names are the same. The files are  expected to be in the same directory  as
    Toxtree.jar (the executable file of the Toxtree application). If the  files
    are not found there, the  corresponding rules behave  as "NOT  IMPLEMENTED"
    and answer "NO" for every compound;

    - Q4: treat the compound as free acid, amine, unsulphonated or  unsulphated
    compound except  for  the purposes of  Q24 and Q33  (as specified in  Q4 of
    Cramer rules);

    - Q15,  Q17,  Q29,  Q30, Q31:  hydrolysis products  (if  any) are processed
    separately,  as  required by  these  rules. If  the  products are  assigned
    different classes, the entire compound will be assigned the most  hazardous
    class (i.e. - if one  product is of class I  and another of class III,  the
    entire compound is considered of class III);

    - ionic  representation of  compounds is  processed correctly  now (please,
    report any exceptions);

    -  checked that  the following  input  file  types are  processed correctly
    (File/Open):

    CML
    CSV - comma delimited, has a header;
    HIN
    ICHI
    INCHI
    MDL MOL
    MDL SDF
    MOL2
    PDB
    SMI - each  line starts with  a SMILES, optional  name delimited by  single
    space, no header);
    TXT - tab delimited;
    XYZ

    - input/output of CSV and TXT: a column with "SMILES" heading is  mandatory
    in order the structure to be  read. All other fields are optional,  will be
    read as molecule properties and displayed as such;

    - all the properties from SDF files are read;

    - output (File/Save): molecules  can be written to  SDF, CSV or TXT  files,
    together with their Cramer classification data (class & path);

    - decision tree results are  written as SDF properties or  CSV/TXT columns.
    The     class      assignment     is      stored     in      a     property
    "toxTree.tree.cramer.CramerRules". The  tree path  is stored  in a property
    "toxTree.tree.cramer.CramerTreeResult";

    - added a  batch processing facility.  It allows faster  processing without
    loading simultaneously  all the  compounds into  memory. Please,  use batch
    processing if the file has more  than thousand compounds. A batch could  be
    paused,  continued  after  pause or  cancelled.  Batch  configuration (i.e.
    input/output file and processed records) could be  saved in a file,  loaded
    and continued in a later moment, even after the application has been closed
    and started again later. Batch  configuration is saved in a  temporary file
    by default. This file is  deleted if  the batch completes  successfully. If
    the batch configuration is saved into a user defined file, it will  persist
    even after the batch completes;

    -  moved  the  SMILES  entry  panel  from   the  left  to  the  top  of the
    application window;

    - history of entered SMILES' is kept in a drop down list;

    - the left  panel now displays  all the properties  defined for a  molecule
    (not only CAS, SMILES and NAME as in the previous version). The  properties
    are read from a file (e.g.  CSV columns, SDF fields) or set   when decision
    tree estimation  is performed.  When the  compound is  created  from SMILES
    (using the SMILES  entry panel at  the top) the  property SMILES is  set as
    well as a remark "Created from SMILES";

    -  compounds, consisting  of more  than one  disconnected moiety,  are now
    displayed;

    - removed  the "Explain"  button on  the right  panel, since  the result is
    automatically explained on estimation. A check box "Verbose explanation" is
    added instead. It affects the way results are explained;

    - since there can be more than one hydrolysis product, the results for each
    product are displayed in brackets ();

    - the application can be configured  to output a lot of information  on its
    behaviour. This could be useful for debugging as well as for detailed study
    of decision  tree results.  In order  to start  the application  and output
    debugging messages  to the  console, type  on a  command line the following
    command:

    java -DtoxTree.debugging=true -jar toxTree.jar

    To store log in a file use: 

    java -DtoxTree.debugging=true -jar toxTree.jar > toxTree.log

    - minor enhancements of the installer;

    - updated README.

    * Toxtree-v0.01 (build date 24 Aug 2005):

    - first public beta-release of the Toxtree application.
